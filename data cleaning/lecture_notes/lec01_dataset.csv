1,Introduction,Welcome to DSC 10! üëã,"DSC 10 is a guided tour of data science.

It was developed by UC Berkeley in 2015 and adapted by UCSD in 2017. It was developed by UC Berkeley in 2015 and adapted by UCSD in 2017. You'll learn just enough programming and statistics to do data science.

We'll cover statistics without too much math ‚Äì instead, we'll use simulation.
This class lays the foundation for all other courses in the DSC major. We'll cover statistics without too much math ‚Äì instead, we'll use simulation. This class lays the foundation for all other courses in the DSC major."

1,Introduction,"What is ""data science""?","Data science is about drawing useful conclusions from data using computation. Throughout the quarter, we'll touch on several aspects of data science: First 4 weeks: use Python to explore data.

Lots of visualization üìàüìä and ""data manipulation"", using industry-standard tools. Lots of visualization üìàüìä and ""data manipulation"", using industry-standard tools. Next 4 weeks: use data to infer about a population, given just a sample.

Rely heavily on simulation, rather than formulas. Rely heavily on simulation, rather than formulas. Last 2 weeks: use data from the past to predict what may happen in the future.

1,Introduction,Data science is relevant ü§ß,We spent years looking at graphs like this:
1,Introduction,"It can be fun, too!",The site The Pudding is home to several interactive data-rich articles.
1,Introduction,Course website,The course website is your one-stop-shop for all things related to the course.
1,Introduction,dsc10.com,"This is where lectures, homeworks, labs, discussions, and all other content will be posted. Check it often, and read the syllabus!"
1,Introduction,Getting set up,"Ed: Q&A forum. All announcements will be made here. You should have gotten email invitation; if not, join here. Gradescope: Where you will submit all assignments, and where all of your grades will live. You will be automatically added to Gradescope within 24 hours of enrolling in the course. DataHub: Where you will access and run all code in this class. Access at datahub.ucsd.edu. Learn how to use it in today's discussion section! We will not be using Canvas for anything!"
1,Introduction,First tasks,"Fill out the required Welcome Survey as soon as possible. Take the pretest, which will help you gauge your preparedness, brush up on prerequisite knowledge, and learn test-taking skills. Solutions will be posted on Wednesday."
1,Introduction,Lecture,"Lectures will be in-person and recorded for viewing afterwards.

You can attend any lecture section, as long as there is space for the students officially enrolled in that section.
Recordings can be found at podcast.ucsd.edu a few hours later. You can attend any lecture section, as long as there is space for the students officially enrolled in that section. Recordings can be found at podcast.ucsd.edu a few hours later. Slides/code from lecture will be linked on the course website, both in a ""runnable"" code format and as an HTML file (‚úèÔ∏è), which you can save as a PDF and annotate on your tablet. We will try to make lectures engaging. Bring your laptop or tablet, if you have one."
1,Introduction,Concept Check ‚úÖ ‚Äì Answer at cc.dsc10.com,"Is it acceptable to recline your seat on an airplane? A. Yes, you paid for the seat! B. Only if the person in front of you reclined their seat first. C. Only if you ask the person behind you and they're fine with it. D. No, it's rude. (We are always going to use the same link for Concept Checks, so you should bookmark it.)"
1,Introduction,Discussion,"The first discussion section is Wednesday. Our TA, Arya, will help you get set up with Jupyter notebooks, the programming environment we'll be using all quarter. In future discussions, you will practice with the conceptual ideas in the course and prepare for quizzes and exams by working through past quiz and exam problems (see practice.dsc10.com).

Problem sets are posted online, so bring a computer or tablet to access them. But like quizzes and exams, you will answer the problems on paper.
Problem sets aren't submitted anywhere.
No podcasting; you need to be an active participant in these sessions to benefit. Problem sets are posted online, so bring a computer or tablet to access them. But like quizzes and exams, you will answer the problems on paper. Problem sets aren't submitted anywhere. No podcasting; you need to be an active participant in these sessions to benefit.

1,Introduction,Labs,"Labs refer to lab assignments, which are a required part of the course and help you develop fluency in Python and working with data. While working on labs, you'll be able to run autograder tests which tell you if your answers are correct.

For labs, if you pass all autograder tests, you will get 100\%! For labs, if you pass all autograder tests, you will get 100\%! You must submit labs individually, but you can discuss ideas with others (no sharing code). All assignments, including labs will be due at 11:59PM on the due date and submitted to Gradescope. The first lab will have submission instructions."
1,Introduction,Homeworks and projects,"Weekly homework assignments build off of skills you develop in labs. A key difference between homeworks and labs is that passing autograder tests does not guarantee a perfect score!

In homeworks, we have ""hidden tests"" that are only run after you submit the assignment.
The tests that are available to you within the assignment itself only verify that your answer is reasonable/on the right track. In homeworks, we have ""hidden tests"" that are only run after you submit the assignment. The tests that are available to you within the assignment itself only verify that your answer is reasonable/on the right track. Again, you must work on homeworks yourself, but you can discuss ideas with other students (no sharing code). In the Midterm Project and Final Project, you will do a deep dive into a dataset! Projects are longer than homeworks, so we give you more time to work on them. They're also very rewarding!

You can work on projects with partners, following these project partner guidelines. Both of you should actively contribute to all parts of the project. You can work on projects with partners, following these project partner guidelines. Both of you should actively contribute to all parts of the project."
1,Introduction,Quizzes,"There will be five quizzes throughout the quarter, meant to help prepare you for exams and encourage you to review material regularly. Only your three best quiz scores will count. This is intended to give you room to fail and learn from your mistakes. It also helps if you need to miss a quiz. There are no makeup quizzes. We will offer five sessions for quizzes. Let us know your preferences on the Welcome Survey. We will confirm your assigned quiz time by email before Monday of Week 2.

Quiz Session 1: Friday 2-2:20PM in Center 109
Quiz Session 2: Friday 2:30-2:50PM in Center 109

1,Introduction,Advice from previous students,"At the end of each quarter, we ask DSC 10 students to give advice to future students in the course. Here are some responses from last quarter's students: Start the assignments (especially the midterm/final projects) early! It became so manageable with more time to split up sections and think things through without a crazy overbearing time pressure. Be prepared to spend a lot of time in this class, regardless of whether you have any prior knowledge in programming or statistics. Everything is doable, but you will need to put in a significant amount of effort to succeed and sometimes you'll have to think outside of the box to come up with solutions. Go to office hours!! It is the best resource available. The tutors are more than willing to help you out. The tutors made my time at DSC 10 not only manageable but also enjoyable. Also, prepare for the quizzes at least one day in advance so that you can retain the material better. Practice is the most important thing you can do to succeed in this course. Also, grab a friend - two (or more) heads are better than one! And don't be afraid to ask for help when needed."
1,Introduction,Academic Integrity policies,"Collaboration Discuss all questions with each other (except, of course, on quizzes and exams). Projects are submitted in pairs or individually. Both partners should contribute to all parts of the project, not split it up. Labs and homeworks are submitted individually. No other person should complete your work for you or write any of the code you submit in this course, with the exception of the work you do with a project partner. Don't give someone else your code or look at someone else's code. Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) The syllabus includes a discussion of these tools and how you may use them in this class. Please read this carefully, ask questions about it, and proceed with care!"

CHAPTER ONE

PLAYING PILGRIMS

""Christmas won't be Christmas without any presents,"" grumbled Jo, lying
on the rug.

""It's so dreadful to be poor!"" sighed Meg, looking down at her old
dress.

""I don't think it's fair for some girls to have plenty of pretty
things, and other girls nothing at all,"" added little Amy, with an
injured sniff.

""We've got Father and Mother, and each other,"" said Beth contentedly
from her corner.

The four young faces on which the firelight shone brightened at the
cheerful words, but darkened again as Jo said sadly, ""We haven't got
Father, and shall not have him for a long time."" She didn't say
""perhaps never,"" but each silently added it, thinking of Father far
away, where the fighting was.

Nobody spoke for a minute; then Meg said in an altered tone, ""You know
the reason Mother proposed not having any presents this Christmas was
because it is going to b Input: # Create a variable ""chapters"" by splitting the text on 'CHAPTER '.
