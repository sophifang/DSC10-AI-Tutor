28,"Review, Conclusion",Announcements,"The Final Exam is tomorrow, June 8th, from 7-10PM in Solis 104 and Solis 107. See this post on Ed for more details.

Check your email for an assigned seat. Check your email for an assigned seat. If at least 75% of the class fills out both SETs and the internal End-of-Quarter Survey by tomorrow at 8AM, then the entire class will have 1% of extra credit added to their overall grade."
28,"Review, Conclusion",Agenda,More review of old exam problems. Working on personal projects. Demo: Gapminder üåé. Some parting thoughts.
28,"Review, Conclusion",Selected problems,"We're going to work on as many of the following problems as we can in class. There's a PDF template linked on the course website that you can write on; we'll post annotated slides after class. Winter 2023 Final Exam, Problem 16 (CLT and hypothesis testing). Winter 2024 Final Exam, Problem 9 (merge). Winter 2024 Final Exam, Problem 11 (TVD)."
28,"Review, Conclusion",Using Jupyter Notebooks after DSC 10,"You may be interested in working on data science projects of your own. In this video, we show you how to make blank notebooks and upload datasets of your own to DataHub. After this quarter, depending on the classes you're enrolled in, you may not have access to DataHub. Eventually, you'll want to install Jupyter Notebooks on your computer.

Anaconda is a great way to do that, as it also installs many commonly used packages.
You may want to download your work from DataHub so you can refer to it after the course ends (though you can look at it on Gradescope too).
Remember, all babypandas code is regular pandas code, too! Anaconda is a great way to do that, as it also installs many commonly used packages. You may want to download your work from DataHub so you can refer to it after the course ends (though you can look at it on Gradescope too). Remember, all babypandas code is regular pandas code, too!"
28,"Review, Conclusion",Finding data,These sites allow you to search for datasets (in CSV format) from a variety of different domains. Some may require you to sign up for an account; these are generally reputable sources. Note that all of these links are also available at rampure.org/find-datasets. Data is Plural FiveThirtyEight. CORGIS. Kaggle Datasets. Google‚Äôs dataset search. DataHub.io. Data.world. R datasets. Wikipedia. (Use this site to extract and download tables as CSVs.) Awesome Public Datasets GitHub repo. Links to even more sources.
28,"Review, Conclusion",Domain-specific sources of data,"Sports: Basketball Reference, Baseball Reference, etc. US Government Sources: census.gov, data.gov, data.ca.gov, data.sfgov.org, FBI‚Äôs Crime Data Explorer, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Global Development: data.worldbank.org, databank.worldbank.org, WHO. Transportation: New York Taxi trips, Bureau of Transportation Statistics, SFO Air Traffic Statistics. Music: Spotify Charts. COVID: Johns Hopkins. Any Google Forms survey you‚Äôve administered! (Go to the results spreadsheet, then go to ‚ÄúFile > Download > Comma-separated values‚Äù.) Tip: if a site only allows you to download a file as an Excel file, not a CSV file, you can download it, open it in a spreadsheet viewer (Excel, Numbers, Google Sheets), and export it to a CSV."
28,"Review, Conclusion",plotly,"All of the visualizations (scatter plots, histograms, etc.) in this course were created using a library called matplotlib.

This library was called under-the-hood everytime we wrote df.plot. This library was called under-the-hood everytime we wrote df.plot. plotly is a different visualization library that allows us to create interactive visualizations. You may learn about it in a future course, but we'll briefly show you some cool visualizations you can make with it. Input: import plotly.express as px"
28,"Review, Conclusion",Gapminder dataset,"Gapminder Foundation is a non-profit venture registered in Stockholm, Sweden, that promotes sustainable global development and achievement of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals by increased use and understanding of statistics and other information about social, economic and environmental development at local, national and global levels. - Gapminder Wikipedia Input: gapminder = px.data.gapminder()

28,"Review, Conclusion","From Lecture 1: What is ""data science""?","Data science is about drawing useful conclusions from data using computation. Throughout the quarter, we touched on several aspects of data science: In the first 4 weeks, we used Python to explore data.

Lots of visualization üìàüìä and ""data manipulation"", using industry-standard tools. Lots of visualization üìàüìä and ""data manipulation"", using industry-standard tools. In the next 4 weeks, we used data to infer about a population, given just a sample.

Rely heavily on simulation, rather than formulas. Rely heavily on simulation, rather than formulas. In the last 2 weeks, we used data from the past to predict what may happen in the future.
