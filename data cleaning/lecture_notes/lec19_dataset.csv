19,"Choosing Sample Sizes, Statistical Models",Recap: The Central Limit Theorem,Input: show_clt_slides()
19,"Choosing Sample Sizes, Statistical Models",The Central Limit Theorem,"The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) says that the probability distribution of the sum or mean of a large random sample drawn with replacement will be roughly normal, regardless of the distribution of the population from which the sample is drawn. The distribution of the sample mean is centered at the population mean, and its standard deviation is When we collect a single sample, we won't know the population mean or SD, so we'll use the sample mean and SD as approximations. Key idea: The CLT allows us to estimate the distribution of the sample mean, given just a single sample, without having to bootstrap!"
19,"Choosing Sample Sizes, Statistical Models",Confidence intervals for the population mean,"A 95% confidence interval for the population mean is given by This CI doesn't require bootstrapping, and it only requires three numbers ‚Äì the sample mean, the sample SD, and the sample size!"
19,"Choosing Sample Sizes, Statistical Models",Bootstrapping vs. the CLT,"Bootstrapping still has its uses! Bootstrapping

19,"Choosing Sample Sizes, Statistical Models",Polling,"You want to estimate the proportion of UCSD students that use BeReal. To do so, you will ask a random sample of UCSD students whether or not they use BeReal. You want to create a confidence interval that has:

A 95% confidence level.
A width of at most 0.06.
The interval (0.21, 0.25) would be fine, but the interval (0.21, 0.28) would not. A 95% confidence level. A width of at most 0.06. The interval (0.21, 0.25) would be fine, but the interval (0.21, 0.28) would not. Question: How big of a sample do you need? ü§î"
19,"Choosing Sample Sizes, Statistical Models",Aside: Proportions are means!,"The sample we collect will consist of only two unique values:

1, if the student uses BeReal.
0, if they don't. 1, if the student uses BeReal. 0, if they don't. We're interested in the proportion of values in our sample that are 1. This proportion is the same as the mean of our sample! For instance, suppose our sample is $0, 1, 1, 0, 1$. Then $\frac{3}{5}$ of the values are $1$. The sample mean is Key takeaway: The CLT applies in this case as well! The distribution of the proportion of 1s in our sample is roughly normal."
19,"Choosing Sample Sizes, Statistical Models",Our strategy,"We will: Collect a random sample. Compute the sample mean (i.e., the proportion of people who say ""yes""). Compute the sample standard deviation. Construct a 95% confidence interval for the population mean: Note that the width of our CI is the right endpoint minus the left endpoint:"
19,"Choosing Sample Sizes, Statistical Models",Our strategy,"We want a CI whose width is at most 0.06. The width of our confidence interval depends on two things: the sample SD and the sample size. If we know the sample SD, we can find the appropriate sample size by re-arranging the following inequality: Problem: Before polling, we don't know the sample SD, because we don't have a sample! We don't know the population SD either. Solution: Find an upper bound ‚Äì i.e. the largest possible value ‚Äì for the sample SD and use that."
19,"Choosing Sample Sizes, Statistical Models",Upper bound for the standard deviation of a sample,"Without any information about the values in a sample, we can't make any guarantees about the standard deviation of the sample. However, in this case, we know that the only values in our sample will be 0 (""no"") and 1 (""yes""). In Homework 5, we introduce a formula for the standard deviation of a collection of 0s and 1s: Input: # Plot the SD of a collection of 0s and 1s with p proportion of Os.
p = np.arange(0, 1.01, 0.01)
sd = np.sqrt(p * (1 - p))
plt.plot(p, sd)
plt.xlabel('p')
plt.ylabel(r'$\sqrt{p(1-p)}$'); Fact: The largest possible value of the SD of a collection of 0s and 1s is 0.5.

This happens when half the values are 0 and half are 1. This happens when half the values are 0 and half are 1."
19,"Choosing Sample Sizes, Statistical Models",Choosing a sample size,"In the sample we will collect, the maximum possible SD is 0.5. Earlier, we saw that to construct a confidence interval with the desired confidence level and width, our sample size needs to satisfy: Notice that as the sample SD increases, the required sample size increases. By using the maximum possible SD above, we ensure that we collect a large enough sample, no matter what the population and sample look like."
19,"Choosing Sample Sizes, Statistical Models",Choosing a sample size,"By substituting 0.5 for the sample size, we get While any sample size that satisfies the above inequality will give us a confidence interval that satisfies the necessary properties, it's time-consuming to gather larger samples than necessary. So, we'll pick the smallest sample size that satisfies the above inequality. Input: (4 * 0.5 / 0.06) ** 2 Output: 1111.1111111111113 Conclusion: We must sample 1112 people to construct a 95% CI for the population mean that is at most 0.06 wide."
19,"Choosing Sample Sizes, Statistical Models",Activity,"Suppose we instead want an a 95% CI for the population mean that is at most 0.03 wide. What is the smallest sample size we could collect? Therefore, the smallest sample size we could collect is 4445."
19,"Choosing Sample Sizes, Statistical Models",Statistical inference,"So far in the second half of this class, we've focused on the problem of parameter estimation.

Given a single sample, we can construct a confidence interval using bootstrapping (for most statistics) or the CLT (for the sample mean).
This confidence interval gives us a range of estimates for a parameter. Given a single sample, we can construct a confidence interval using bootstrapping (for most statistics) or the CLT (for the sample mean). This confidence interval gives us a range of estimates for a parameter. Next, we'll turn our attention to answering yes-no questions about the relationships between samples and populations.

Example: Does it look like this jury panel was drawn randomly from this population of eligible jurors?
Example: Does it look like this sequence of coin tosses was generated by a fair coin? Example: Does it look like this jury panel was drawn randomly from this population of eligible jurors? Example: Does it look like this sequence of coin tosses was generated by a fair coin? Both of these problems fall under the umbrella of statistical inference ‚Äì using a sample to draw conclusions about the population."
19,"Choosing Sample Sizes, Statistical Models",Models,A model is a set of assumptions about how data was generated.
19,"Choosing Sample Sizes, Statistical Models",Goal,"Our goal is to assess the quality of a model. Suppose we have access to a dataset. What we'll try to do is determine whether a model ""explains"" the patterns in the dataset."
19,"Choosing Sample Sizes, Statistical Models","Swain vs. Alabama, 1965","Robert Swain was a Black man convicted of crime in Talladega County, Alabama. He appealed the jury's decision all the way to the Supreme Court, on the grounds that Talladega County systematically excluded Black people from juries. At the time, only men 21 years or older were allowed to serve on juries. 26% of this eligible population was Black. But of the 100 men on Robert Swain's jury panel, only 8 were Black."
19,"Choosing Sample Sizes, Statistical Models",Supreme Court ruling,"About disparities between the percentages in the eligible population and the jury panel, the Supreme Court wrote: ""... the overall percentage disparity has been small...‚Äù The Supreme Court denied Robert Swain‚Äôs appeal and he was sentenced to life in prison. We now have the tools to show quantitatively that the Supreme Court's claim was misguided. This ""overall percentage disparity"" turns out to be not so small, and is an example of racial bias.

Jury panels were often made up of people in the jury commissioner's professional and social circles.
Of the 8 Black men on the jury panel, none were selected to be part of the actual jury. Jury panels were often made up of people in the jury commissioner's professional and social circles. Of the 8 Black men on the jury panel, none were selected to be part of the actual jury."
19,"Choosing Sample Sizes, Statistical Models",Setup,"Model: Jury panels consist of 100 men, randomly chosen from a population that is 26% Black. Observation: On the actual jury panel, only 8 out of 100 men were Black. Question: Does the model explain the observation?"
19,"Choosing Sample Sizes, Statistical Models",Our approach: Simulation,"We'll start by assuming that the model is true. We'll generate many jury panels using this assumption. We'll count the number of Black men in each simulated jury panel to see how likely it is for a random panel to contain 8 or fewer Black men.

If we see 8 or fewer Black men often, then the model seems reasonable.
If we rarely see 8 or fewer Black men, then the model may not be reasonable. If we see 8 or fewer Black men often, then the model seems reasonable. If we rarely see 8 or fewer Black men, then the model may not be reasonable."
19,"Choosing Sample Sizes, Statistical Models",Simulating statistics,"Recall, a statistic is a number calculated from a sample. Our plan: Run an experiment once to generate one value of our chosen statistic.

In this case, sample 100 people randomly from a population that is 26% Black, and count the number of Black men (statistic). In this case, sample 100 people randomly from a population that is 26% Black, and count the number of Black men (statistic). Run the experiment many times, generating many values of the statistic, and store these statistics in an array. Visualize the resulting empirical distribution of the statistic."
19,"Choosing Sample Sizes, Statistical Models",Step 1 ‚Äì Running the experiment once,"How do we randomly sample a jury panel?

np.random.choice won't help us, because we don't know how large the eligible population is. np.random.choice won't help us, because we don't know how large the eligible population is. The function np.random.multinomial helps us sample at random from a categorical distribution. Input: np.random.multinomial(sample_size, pop_distribution) np.random.multinomial samples at random from the population, with replacement, and returns a random array containing counts in each category.

pop_distribution needs to be an array containing the probabilities of each category. pop_distribution needs to be an array containing the probabilities of each category. Aside: Example usage of np.random.multinomial On Halloween üëª, you trick-or-treated at 35 houses, each of which had an identical candy box, containing: 30% Starbursts. 30% Sour Patch Kids. 40% Twix. At each house, you selected one candy blindly from the candy box. To simulate the act of going to 35 houses, we can use np.random.multinomial: Input: np.random.multinomial(35, [0.3, 0.3, 0.4]) Output: array([10,  9, 16])"
19,"Choosing Sample Sizes, Statistical Models",Step 1 ‚Äì Running the experiment once,"In our case, a randomly selected member of our population is Black with probability 0.26 and not Black with probability 1 - 0.26 = 0.74. Input: demographics = [0.26, 0.74] Each time we run the following cell, we'll get a new random sample of 100 people from this population. The first element of the resulting array is the number of Black men in the sample. The second element is the number of non-Black men in the sample. Input: np.random.multinomial(100, demographics) Output: array([23, 77])"
19,"Choosing Sample Sizes, Statistical Models",Step 1 ‚Äì Running the experiment once,"We also need to calculate the statistic, which in this case is the number of Black men in the random sample of 100. Input: np.random.multinomial(100, demographics)[0] Output: 25"
19,"Choosing Sample Sizes, Statistical Models",Step 2 ‚Äì Repeat the experiment many times,"Let's run 10,000 simulations. We'll keep track of the number of Black men in each simulated jury panel in the array counts. Input: counts = np.array([])

for i in np.arange(10000):
    new_count = np.random.multinomial(100, demographics)[0]
    counts = np.append(counts, new_count)
    
counts Output: array([42., 31., 21., ..., 30., 26., 26.])"
19,"Choosing Sample Sizes, Statistical Models",Step 3 ‚Äì Visualize the resulting distribution,"Was a jury panel with 8 Black men suspiciously unusual? Input: (bpd.DataFrame().assign(count_black_men=counts)
                .plot(kind='hist', bins = np.arange(9.5, 45, 1), 
                      density=True, ec='w', figsize=(10, 5),
                      title='Empiricial Distribution of the Number of Black Men in Simulated Jury Panels of Size 100'));
observed_count = 8
plt.axvline(observed_count, color='black', linewidth=4, label='Observed Number of Black Men in Actual Jury Panel')
plt.legend(); Input: # In 10,000 random experiments, the panel with the fewest Black men had how many?
counts.min() Output: 11.0"
19,"Choosing Sample Sizes, Statistical Models",Conclusion,"Our simulation shows that there's essentially no chance that a random sample of 100 men drawn from a population in which 26% of men are Black will contain 8 or fewer Black men. As a result, it seems that the model we proposed ‚Äì that the jury panel was drawn at random from the eligible population ‚Äì is flawed. There were likely factors other than chance that explain why there were only 8 Black men on the jury panel."
19,"Choosing Sample Sizes, Statistical Models",Summary,"A 95% confidence interval for the population mean is given by If we want to construct a confidence interval of a particular width and confidence level for a population proportion:

Choose a confidence level (e.g. 95%) and maximum width (e.g. 0.06).
Solve for the minimum sample size that satisfies both conditions.
Collect a sample of that size.
Use the formula above to construct an interval. Choose a confidence level (e.g. 95%) and maximum width (e.g. 0.06). Solve for the minimum sample size that satisfies both conditions. Collect a sample of that size. Use the formula above to construct an interval. A model is an assumption about how data was generated. We're interested in determining the validity a model, given some data we've collected. When assessing a model, we consider two viewpoints of the world: one where the model is true, and another where the model is false for some reason."
19,"Choosing Sample Sizes, Statistical Models",Next time,"Next time, we'll see more examples of testing models and deciding between two viewpoints. We'll formalize this notion, which is called hypothesis testing."
