p,C. str(x) + int(y)
p,D. str(x) + z
p,E. All of them have errors
h2,Means and medians
h3,Describing numerical data
li,"We now know how to store individual numbers (as ints or floats) and pieces of text (as strings). But we often we'll work with sequences, or ordered collections, of several data values."
li,"For any collection of numbers, say temperatures, it can be helpful to summarize the data by its mean (i.e. average) or median."
li,"Both mean and median are measures of central tendency – that is, they tell us roughly where the ""center"" of the data falls."
h3,The mean (i.e. average)
p,The mean is a one-number summary of a collection of numbers.
p,"For example, the mean of $1$, $4$, $7$, and $12$ is $\frac{1 + 4 + 7 + 12}{4} = 6$."
p,Observe that the mean:
li,Doesn't have to be equal to one of the data points.
li,"Doesn't have to be an integer, even if all of the data points are integers."
li,"Is somewhere between the min and max, but not necessarily halfway between."
li,Has the same units as the data.
h3,The median
p,"Like the mean, the median is a one-number summary of a collection of numbers."
li,"To calculate it, sort the data points and pick the number in the middle.
If there are two middle numbers, we usually pick the number halfway between (i.e. the mean of the middle two)."
li,"Example: 
$\text{Median}(1, 4, 7, 12, 32) = 7$
$\text{Median}(1, 4, 7, 12) = 5.5$"
h3,Mean vs. median
li,"The mean and median of a dataset can be the same, but they don't need to be. They measure the center of a dataset in two different ways."
li,"Two different datasets can have the same mean without having the same median, and vice versa."
h3,Activity
li,Find two different datasets that have the same mean and different medians.
p,Find two different datasets that have the same mean and different medians.
li,Find two different datasets that have the same median and different means.
p,Find two different datasets that have the same median and different means.
li,Find two different datasets that have the same median and the same mean.
p,Find two different datasets that have the same median and the same mean.
p,Means and medians are just summaries; they don't tell the whole story about a dataset!
img,https://dsc-courses.github.io/dsc10-2024-sp/resources/lectures/lec03/images/histograms.png
p,"In a few weeks, we'll learn about how to visualize the distribution of a collection of numbers using a histogram."
p,These two distributions have different means but the same median!
h2,Lists
h3,Average temperature for a week
p,How would we store the temperatures for a week to compute the average temperature?
p,Our best solution right now is to create a separate variable for each day of the week.
pre input,"temp_sunday = 68
temp_monday = 73
temp_tuesday = 70
temp_wednesday = 74
temp_thursday = 76
temp_friday = 72
temp_saturday = 74"
p,This technically allows us to do things like compute the average temperature:
pre input,"avg_temperature = 1/7 * (
    temp_sunday
    + temp_monday
    + temp_tuesday
    + ...)"
p,"Imagine a whole month's data, or a whole year's data. It seems like we need a better solution."
h3,Lists in Python
p,"In Python, a list is used to store multiple values within a single value. To create a new list from scratch, we use [square brackets]."
pre input,"temperature_list = [68, 73, 70, 74, 76, 72, 74]"
pre input,len(temperature_list)
pre output,7
p,Notice that the elements in a list don't need to be unique!
h3,Lists make working with sequences easy!
p,"To find the average temperature, we just need to divide the sum of the temperatures by the number of temperatures recorded:"
pre input,temperature_list
pre output,"[68, 73, 70, 74, 76, 72, 74]"
pre input,sum(temperature_list) / len(temperature_list)
pre output,72.42857142857143
h3,Types
p,The type of a list is... list.
pre input,temperature_list
pre output,"[68, 73, 70, 74, 76, 72, 74]"
pre input,type(temperature_list)
pre output,list
p,"Within a list, you can store elements of different types."
pre input,"mixed_list = [-2, 2.5, 'ucsd', [1, 3]]
mixed_list"
pre output,"[-2, 2.5, 'ucsd', [1, 3]]"
h3,There's a problem...
li,Lists are very slow.
li,"This is not a big deal when there aren't many entries, but it's a big problem when there are millions or billions of entries."
h2,Arrays
h3,NumPy
img,https://dsc-courses.github.io/dsc10-2024-sp/resources/lectures/lec03/images/numpy.png
li,"NumPy (pronounced ""num pie"") is a Python library (module) that provides support for arrays and operations on them."
p,"NumPy (pronounced ""num pie"") is a Python library (module) that provides support for arrays and operations on them."
li,"The babypandas library, which you will learn about soon, goes hand-in-hand with NumPy.

NumPy is used heavily in the real world."
li,"To use numpy, we need to import it. It's usually imported as np (but doesn't have to be!)"
p,"To use numpy, we need to import it. It's usually imported as np (but doesn't have to be!)"
pre input,import numpy as np
h3,Arrays
p,"Think of NumPy arrays (just ""arrays"" from now on) as fancy, faster lists."
img,https://dsc-courses.github.io/dsc10-2024-sp/resources/lectures/lec03/images/fast-slow.jpg
p,"To create an array, we pass a list as input to the np.array function."
pre input,"np.array([4, 9, 1, 2])"
pre output,"array([4, 9, 1, 2])"
img,https://dsc-courses.github.io/dsc10-2024-sp/resources/lectures/lec03/images/brackets.png

pre input,temperature_list
pre output,"[68, 73, 70, 74, 76, 72, 74]"
pre input,"# No square brackets, because temperature_list is already a list!
np.array(temperature_list)"
pre output,"array([68, 73, 70, 74, 76, 72, 74])"
h3,Positions
p,"When people wait in line, each person has a position."
img,https://dsc-courses.github.io/dsc10-2024-sp/resources/lectures/lec03/images/waiting-room.jpg
p,"Similarly, each element of an array (and list) has a position."
h3,Accessing elements by position
li,"Python, like most programming languages, is ""0-indexed."" 
This means that the position of the first element in an array is 0, not 1. 
One interpretation is that an element's position represents the number of elements in front of it."
li,"To access the element in array arr_name at position pos, we use the syntax arr_name[pos]."

h3,Element-wise arithmetic
li,"We can apply arithmetic operations to multiple arrays, provided they have the same length."

h2,"Summary, next time"
h3,Summary
li,Strings are used to store text. Enclose them in single or double quotes.
li,"Lists and arrays are used to store sequences.
Arrays are faster and more convenient for numerical operations.
Access elements by position, starting at position 0."

h3,Next time
p,We'll learn more about arrays and we'll see how to use Python to work with real-world tabular data.
